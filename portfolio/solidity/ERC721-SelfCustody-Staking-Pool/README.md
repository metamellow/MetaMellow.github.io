## Description

This project is a **Solidity contract** that I developed for claiming NFT tokens. It demonstrates my skills in Solidity programming and understanding of blockchain concepts.

## Problem

The contract was developed to address the following problems:

- **Claiming**: Users need a way to claim their NFT tokens.
- **Timing**: The claiming process should be timed to prevent abuse.

## Solution

The contract solves the problem by implementing the following steps:

1. **Claim**: Users can claim their NFT tokens.
2. **Time Check**: The contract checks the time since the last claim.
3. **Reward**: The contract calculates the reward for each claim.
