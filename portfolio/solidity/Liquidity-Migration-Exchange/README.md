## Description

This project is a **Solidity contract** that I developed for a token exchange system. It demonstrates my skills in Solidity programming and understanding of blockchain concepts.

## Problem Statement

The contract was developed to address the following problems:

- **Token Exchange**: Users need a way to exchange their $BANK tokens for $BON tokens.
- **Taxation**: A tax should be applied to each transaction, with the tax being sent to a specific address.

## Solution

The contract solves the problem by implementing the following steps:

1. **Exchange**: Users can exchange their $BANK tokens for $BON tokens.
2. **Tax Calculation**: The contract calculates the tax for each transaction.
3. **Tax Transfer**: The contract transfers the tax to a specific address.
