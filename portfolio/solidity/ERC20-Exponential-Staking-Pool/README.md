## Description

This project is a **Solidity contract** that I developed for a staking pool. It demonstrates my skills in Solidity programming and understanding of blockchain concepts.

## Problem Statement

The contract was developed to address the following problems:

- **Staking**: Users need a way to stake their tokens in a pool.
- **Rewards**: Users who stake their tokens should be rewarded based on the amount they stake.

## Solution

The contract solves the problem by implementing the following steps:

1. **Deposit**: Users can deposit tokens into the staking pool.
2. **Calculate Rewards**: The contract calculates rewards for each user based on the amount they have staked.
3. **Withdraw**: Users can withdraw their tokens and rewards from the pool.
